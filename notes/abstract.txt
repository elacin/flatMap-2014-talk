How we ported our application from Java to Scala

Abstract:

In this talk I will tell the story about how we came to port our main application to Scala.

Initial focus will be on motivation for the team and for myself. Then we have a look at how my team tested the waters first, and how that testing developed into a multiphased porting strategy:

- refactor Java codebase to favor immutability and static functions
- mechanically rewrite Java code to Scala
- port Java collections usage to Scala collections, introduce Option when possible
- restore sanity by replacing Hibernate with Scalaquery/Slick
- rewire with cake pattern instead of Spring
- regain control over HTTP by replacing Spring MVC with Unfiltered

By sharing some experience for each of these phases, I hope this talk can be useful for anyone considering doing the same.
